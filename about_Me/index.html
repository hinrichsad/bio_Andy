        <p>I graduated about a year ago with a degree in Forensic science and chemistry. While its a difficult field to
            break into
            I finally secured a spot as a crime scene analyst in Baltimore. Then COVID struck and they decided to cancel
            all hiring.
            At that point I decided to re-evaluate what I wanted to do. At this point I have already done a good amount
            of C# in game dev
            and python for a few different classes and really enjoyed both. So I joined the bootcamp as a way to pivot
            to a new career field.
